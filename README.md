Welcome in this first version of Lorekeeper

This project was inspired by my experience in different roleplay communities, notably on Discord, and the often well needed for a well organized annuary of characters to be able to find their sheet more easily.


To start : 
    - Start a local mysql server, with :
        - a database named 'lorekeeper'
        - username : root
        - password : Test123

    - Execute the .exe


Functions : 
- Add characters
- Delete characters
- View characters details such as their description
- Sort by multiple categories such as level or player


In case the list seems wrong, click 'reset filters', it will reload with up to date informations.


Planned features : 
- Managing multiple world with different characters and players being able to be part of one or more world.
- Authentification for a custom view player by player, able to view all your characters on the same place.


note :
- the imageLink must be a public accessible http(s) link to be viewable.
- Instead of a description, you can put a publicly accessible link to an external character sheet !
